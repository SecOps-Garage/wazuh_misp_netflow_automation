# **CTI automation with Wazuh,MISP and Netflow**

## **Project Background**
In large enterprise networks or data centers, especially those with hundreds of applications hosted across distributed Virtual Machines (VMs), it is not uncommon for the same attacker to attempt web-based attacks across multiple VMs. Given the scale of such networks, some critical VMs might not have proper security agents installed due to resource constraints or operational challenges. Moreover, north-south traffic (traffic between the internal network and external networks) might not always be monitored by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), or worse, it might be evading existing firewall protections.

In such environments, detecting and responding to web-based attacks becomes a major challenge, especially when the attacker is executing coordinated attacks across multiple VMs or applications. Without proper visibility into the traffic and events from these VMs, enterprises are left vulnerable to widespread attacks that could go unnoticed, leading to data breaches or compromises.

To address these issues, the proposed solution automates the process of extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from Wazuh logs, a powerful security monitoring tool, and pushing them to MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform). The solution not only extracts the web attack data from Wazuh but also enhances the detection process by cross-verifying attacker IPs with Netflow traffic data stored in Elasticsearch. This helps identify malicious activity that might have been missed by traditional security measures and ensures a proactive approach to threat intelligence sharing.

In essence, the solution provides continuous monitoring and incident response capabilities for detecting web attacks, even in the absence of direct agent installation or when facing challenges such as network misconfigurations and firewall evasion. It creates an automated flow of threat data from Wazuh logs to MISP, ensuring that critical attack data is shared in real-time, enhancing overall security posture and facilitating quicker responses to emerging threats.

## **Project Overview**

This project automates the extraction and sharing of **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from **Wazuh logs** to **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**. It enables real-time sharing of threat intelligence, helping in incident response by automatically pushing web attack data from **Wazuh** into **MISP**. The solution also cross-verifies attacker IPs with internal **Netflow traffic** in **Elasticsearch**, which can help identify additional suspicious activity.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Real-Time Threat Intelligence**: Pushes IOCs to MISP as soon as they are detected in Wazuh logs, enabling rapid response.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Reduces manual intervention by automatically sharing IOCs.
- **Enhanced Detection**: Cross-references IOCs with internal **Netflow traffic** using **Elasticsearch** to detect further attacks.

## **Required Components**

Before setting up the script, ensure that the following components are in place:

### **1. Wazuh Manager**
- The **Wazuh Manager** collects and analyzes security events, including **web access logs**.
- **Alerts** generated by Wazuh are stored as **indices** in **Elasticsearch** for further processing.

### **2. MISP Instance**
- You need a **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)** instance to push the **IOCs** from Wazuh alerts.
- MISP allows for **real-time sharing** of threat intelligence with internal and external stakeholders.

### **3. Netflow Log Collection in Elasticsearch**
- **Netflow logs** should be stored in **Elasticsearch** to cross-verify the attacker IPs detected in Wazuh logs.
- Netflow logs help identify further malicious activity based on network traffic patterns.

### **Additional Notes**

- The provided scripts have been **tested** with **Elasticsearch 7.17.13** and **Wazuh App version 4.53**.
- For **latest versions of Wazuh**, this script **has not yet been tested**, but the **core logic** of the script remains the same. You may need to adjust certain configurations based on your Elasticsearch and Wazuh versions.
