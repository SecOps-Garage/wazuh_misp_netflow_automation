# wazuh_misp_netflow_automation
This project automates the extraction and sharing of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from Wazuh logs to MISP, enabling real-time threat intelligence sharing and incident response. It also cross-verifies attacker IPs with internal Netflow traffic in Elasticsearch to detect additional malicious activity.
